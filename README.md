# lunaria

an original UI library of sorts for Svelte

⚠️ there are no stability guarantees for the API and designs. I don't have the time to satisfy the wider public's use cases (I'm mostly using this in my own projects), so things will remain in flux for now.

## quick start

- Option 1: Copy the components you want out of the library.\
  [Follow the Apache License 2.0 conditions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License#Licensing_conditions)
- Option 2: Add the repository as a git submodule.\
  If doing so, please exempt it from your linting and formatting rules.

I may publish this library in nightly versions for installation via `npm` in the future, so keep a lookout for that if you are pursuing Option 2 (since the project scaffolding will almost certainly break that setup when I do).

## documentation

currently, there is none, but the components are straightforward to use.
